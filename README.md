# QC-STORM
QC-STORM is an online processing plug-in (Micro-Manager & ImageJ) for super-resolution localization imaging with large FOV. At single-molecule fitting mode, QC-STORM is able to process the imaging data generated by sCMOS camera at full FOV and fastest frame rate (2048 x 2048 pixels x 100 fps). Even at high density activation and multi-emitter fitting mode, QC-STORM is able to process images with 1024 x 1024 pixels at 100 fps.
QC-STORM has been publised in paper "Divide and conquer: real-time maximum likelihood fitting of multiple emitters for super-resolution localization microscopy" at https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?URI=oe-27-15-21029

# Key features

Ultrahigh efficient MLE localization: online processing for sCMOS camera based localization microscopy at full FOV and fastest frame rate without sacrificing localization precision (localization speed > 8x10^6 for 7x7 pixels ROI based on Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Graphic Cards). 

Most processing parts of QC-STORM are GPU accelerated, and their performance increase almost linearly with GPUâ€™s single-precision floating-point number operation speed (GFLOPS). Note the speed value could be measured low with small and low activation density image, and the speed may also be reduced by low CPU memory bandwidth and low speed image reading from hard disk.

MLE Localization type: 2D, Astigmatism 3D

Online super-resolution image rendering and statistical information analyzing (photon number, background intensity, SNR, PSF width, localization density, on time)

Online localization precision (CRLB) calculation

Drift correction by cross-correlation (post-processing)

Merging molecules emitting in consecutive frames (localization precision weighted average)

Online feedback control for localization density stabilizing and axial drift correction (hardware dependent)

Sequential Multi-FOV acquisition (hardware dependent)

Configuration parameters remembering, saving and loading

The open dataset evaluation of QC-STORM can be found in http://bigwww.epfl.ch/smlm/challenge2016/index.html using name QC-STORM-2019. Note the evaluation of QC-STORM in recently published paper "Super-resolution fight club: assessment of 2D and 3D single-molecule localization microscopy software" is based on submission in 2017, and the results were only processed by single-molecule localization. Moreover, the double-helix localization mode was removed in current version.


# System requirements and installation
